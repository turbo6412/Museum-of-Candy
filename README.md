# Museum-of-candy
# Created a basic HTML/CSS and Bootstrap project to learn the fundamentals of styling a web page. 


# Here is the museum of candy website showing each exhibit as we scroll down. In addition we start to notice that the navbar changes colors to accomodate for the user's eyes.

# As we start to shrink the window of the website, we can see that it is responsive and will allocate enough space with the current size of the window!

# We also can see that the navbar becomes the dropdown menu once the window reaches mobile size and everything is one column.
